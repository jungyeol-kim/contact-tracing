Tracing and testing multiple generations of close contacts to COVID-19: cost-benefit tradeoffs
===================================



### Contact Networks

*Notes:* *p* is the rewiring probability of Watts-Strogatz networks, and *r* is the mixing parameter in data-driven network. The average degree is the average number of edges per node. The distance between a pair of nodes is the length of the shortest path between them. The diameter is the maximum value of this distance over all pairs of nodes. The average path length is the average of this distance over all pairs of nodes; only the lengths of the existing paths are considered and averaged. Clustering coefficient of a node *i*, *C<sub>i*, is defined as the ratio between the actual number of links between the neighbors of *i* and the maximum possible number of links between the neighbors of *i*. This is high if there exists a large number of edges in the neighborhood of *i*. The average clustering coefficient, *<C>*, is the average of *C<sub>i* over all nodes $i.$ The average degree, average path length, and average clustering coefficient are rounded to three significant figures.

#### Each row/record in the datasets represents a link between two nodes in undirected networks.
#### The raw data used to construct data-driven network was previously published in *A Banerjee, AG Chandrasekhar, E Duflo, MO Jackson, The diffusion of microfinance. Science 341 (2013)*.
